# Future greenhouse gas emissions

This project predicts future greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas production across different countries using historical data. It applies machine learning to uncover patterns in emissions trends, helping organizations better understand environmental impact. The model is trained on data that includes the type of activity, country, and year, and outputs an estimate of CO‚ÇÇ-equivalent emissions. This can support investment research, ESG compliance, or climate strategy decision-making.

Forecasting greenhouse gas emissions helps organizations anticipate their environmental impact and make informed, proactive decisions. By using historical data and machine learning, we can predict future emission levels across countries and sectors, enabling better planning, regulatory compliance, and investment strategies. This is particularly valuable for companies aligning with ESG goals, policymakers targeting emission reductions, and analysts assessing climate-related risks. Accurate forecasts allow stakeholders to identify high-impact areas, allocate resources effectively, and measure progress against sustainability targets. Ultimately, emissions forecasting supports data-driven action in the global effort to mitigate climate change and transition to a low-carbon economy.

## DATA
The dataset used is titled oil-and-gas-production_country_emissions_v4_3_1.csv from https://climatetrace.org/data , which contains emissions data across countries and sub-sectors of the oil and gas industry. The emissions values are expressed in 100-year CO‚ÇÇ-equivalents (co2e_100yr).
Data source: Climate TRACE and related public environmental datasets.
Preprocessing steps included filtering only for CO‚ÇÇ-equivalent gases, removing outliers, and one-hot encoding categorical variables (iso3_country, subsector).

## MODEL 
A Stacking Regressor was used, which combines multiple base models ‚Äî Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Ridge Regression ‚Äî into a single predictive system. The final prediction is made by a Ridge meta-model that integrates the outputs of the base models.
This model was chosen for its robustness, ability to capture complex interactions, and its strong performance on structured/tabular data. Random Forest also allows for interpretability via feature importance and SHAP values.


## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMSATION

Bayesian Optimization was used to tune the following hyperparameters of the Random Forest model:
-n_estimators (number of trees)
-max_depth (tree depth)
-min_samples_split (minimum samples required to split)
Bayesian Optimization was selected over grid or random search due to its efficiency in high-cost optimization settings and its ability to model the error surface intelligently. The optimization process included convergence plots and parameter influence visualization.

## RESULTS
1. Bayesian Optimization Results Table

This is the raw output from the optimizer showing all tested hyperparameter combinations and their resulting performance.
It lists settings like number of trees, depth, and split size. The target column shows the model performance for each combination.

This table helps document the search process and identify the best hyperparameters used in training.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 3.57
R¬≤ Score: 0.89

The model demonstrates strong predictive accuracy, especially in high-emission countries and sectors.
Feature importance and SHAP analysis showed that year, subsector, and specific iso3_country encodings were the most influential predictors.

2. Prediction vs Actual

This scatter plot compares the model‚Äôs predictions to the actual emissions values.
Each dot is a data point.
The black dashed line is the ideal ‚Äúperfect prediction‚Äù line (where prediction = actual).

This chart shows that most predictions are close to the actual values, but also reveals some outliers ‚Äî especially at very high emission levels.

3. Top 15 Feature Importances

This bar chart highlights the top 15 most important features according to the Random Forest model.
The longer the bar, the more important the feature was for making predictions.

It tells us which variables mattered most. Many of the top features are countries, which suggests location plays a big role in emission levels.


4. SHAP Summary Plot

This chart explains which features (like countries or sectors) influenced the model‚Äôs predictions the most.
Each row is a feature (like iso3_country_QAT for Qatar).
The x-axis shows how much each feature affected the prediction (SHAP value).
Red dots mean high feature values, blue dots mean low ones.

It gives insights into why the model made its predictions ‚Äî for example, certain countries had a strong influence on emissions estimates.



4. Bayesian Optimization Convergence Plot

This line plot tracks how model performance improved over time as the optimization algorithm tried different settings.
The x-axis shows each iteration (a new combination of settings).
The y-axis shows the performance for each run ‚Äî again using negative MAE (higher is better).

It confirms that the optimizer learned from previous results and gradually found better model settings.

5.  Hyperparameter Influence Scatter Plot

This chart visualizes the effect of different settings (hyperparameters) for the Random Forest model.
The x-axis shows how many trees the model used (n_estimators).
The y-axis shows the model‚Äôs performance as negative Mean Absolute Error (MAE) ‚Äî the higher (closer to zero), the better.
Bubble color shows the depth of the trees (max_depth) ‚Äî darker is deeper.
Bubble size shows how much data is needed to split a decision (min_samples_split).

It helps us understand which combinations of settings gave the best performance. We can see that shallower trees performed worse, and certain settings produced much better results.
