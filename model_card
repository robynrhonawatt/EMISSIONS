# Model Card

**Input:**  
The model takes tabular input data representing historical oil and gas emissions by country and year. Key input features include:
- `year`
- `iso3_country` (country code, one-hot encoded)
- `subsector` (oil/gas activity classification, one-hot encoded)

**Output:**  
The output is a continuous numerical prediction of **greenhouse gas emissions**, expressed in **CO₂-equivalent over a 100-year timeframe** (co2e_100yr).

**Model Architecture:**  
The model is a **Stacking Regressor** composed of:
- **Base models:**
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
  - Ridge Regression
- **Meta-model:**
  - Ridge Regression, which combines the outputs of the base models to produce the final prediction.

Bayesian Optimisation was used to tune hyperparameters of the Random Forest model:
- `n_estimators` (number of trees)
- `max_depth` (tree depth)
- `min_samples_split` (minimum samples to split a node)

## **Performance**

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 3.57
- **R² Score:** 0.89

The model demonstrates high predictive accuracy on held-out test data. Performance is especially strong in countries and subsectors with higher emission volumes.

**Visualizations include:**
- **Prediction vs Actual Scatter Plot**
- **Top 15 Feature Importances (Random Forest)**
- **SHAP Summary Plot** for interpretability
- **Bayesian Optimisation Convergence Plot**

## **Limitations**

- The model only considers data from the oil and gas sector, and does not generalize to other emission sectors like agriculture or manufacturing.
- It is trained on historical data and assumes future emissions follow similar patterns.
- Interpretability is partially limited by the use of one-hot encoded geographic and categorical variables.
- Some countries with sparse data may show higher error rates or reduced generalisation.

## **Trade-offs**

- **Performance vs Interpretability:**  
  The Stacking Regressor offers strong accuracy but can be harder to interpret than single models. SHAP values are used to mitigate this.

- **Efficiency vs Accuracy:**  
  Bayesian Optimisation improves model performance but increases training time. This was considered acceptable due to the cost-sensitive nature of emissions modeling.

- **Geographic Sensitivity:**  
  Countries with extensive historical reporting perform better. Smaller or underreported regions may have noisier predictions.
