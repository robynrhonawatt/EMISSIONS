# Datasheet

## **Motivation**

- **Purpose:**  
  The dataset was created to enable estimation and analysis of greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas production activities globally. It supports climate modeling, emissions forecasting, sustainability research, and ESG-focused investment analysis.

- **Creators:**  
  The dataset was compiled and published by **Climate TRACE**, a global coalition of climate researchers, nonprofits, and technology companies. Contributors include **WattTime, RMI, Global Energy Monitor**, and others. The effort is funded by various climate-focused organizations and philanthropic donors.

## **Composition**

- **What does the dataset represent?**  
  Each instance represents annual CO₂-equivalent emissions from a specific oil or gas subsector, aggregated by country.

- **Data size:**  
  Thousands of records covering over 100 countries and multiple oil/gas production subsectors.

- **Missing data:**  
  Some records contain missing emissions values or confidence ratings for specific years or subsectors. These are documented using `null` or empty fields.

- **Confidentiality:**  
  No personally identifiable information is included. All data is at the **country or facility level** and is derived from public or open satellite-based monitoring sources. No private or privileged content is included.

## **Collection Process**

- **Data acquisition:**  
  The data is collected from a combination of satellite imagery, remote sensing, machine learning inference models, and integration with public databases.

- **Sampling:**  
  The dataset is **comprehensive**, not a random sample, and aims to capture **all known** oil and gas emission sources at the national and subnational levels.

- **Time frame:**  
  Covers annual data from **2015 to 2023**, depending on country and subsector.

## **Preprocessing / Cleaning / Labeling**

- **Steps taken:**  
  - Filtered for CO₂-equivalent gases only (`co2e_100yr`)
  - Removed rows with zero or null emissions
  - Dropped outliers based on statistical thresholds
  - One-hot encoded categorical features (`iso3_country`, `subsector`)
  - Scaled or transformed certain numerical variables as needed

- **Raw data availability:**  
  Raw data files are publicly available on [Climate TRACE’s data platform](https://climatetrace.org/data), and the cleaned CSV used in this project is documented in the repository.

## **Uses**

- **Additional tasks:**  
  The dataset can be used for:
  - Emissions benchmarking and monitoring
  - Sector-specific policy modeling
  - Regional emissions hotspot detection
  - Climate risk analytics for investors and insurers

- **Bias or risk considerations:**  
  - Some regions may have lower data confidence due to limited satellite visibility or technological constraints.
  - Countries with sparse emissions reporting may skew analysis unless adjustments are made.
  - Users should avoid using this dataset for **individual-level policy enforcement**, as the data is aggregated and modeled.

- **Unsuitable uses:**  
  - Not appropriate for real-time emissions trading or facility-level enforcement without supplementary validation.
  - Should not be used for punitive actions without additional data verification.

## **Distribution**

- **Availability:**  
  Publicly distributed under the **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License** via the Climate TRACE website and GitHub repositories.

- **Licensing:**  
  All data used is either created by Climate TRACE or reproduced from open-access sources, such as EDGAR, FAO, or national greenhouse gas registries. Full terms of use: https://climatetrace.org/terms

## **Maintenance**

- **Maintained by:**  
  Climate TRACE Coalition. Ongoing updates are published on their GitHub page and central platform. The version used in this project is **v4.3.1 (May 2025)**.
